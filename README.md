# Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

## Description
The **Crop Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based application designed to recommend the most suitable crops based on various environmental and soil conditions. It aims to support farmers and agricultural professionals in making data-driven crop selection choices, enhancing yield, and maximizing profitability.

This system considers multiple factors—such as soil type, climate, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH levels—to recommend optimal crops for specific regions. By analyzing historical data and using predictive models, it offers personalized recommendations tailored to the unique conditions of a farm or agricultural area.

## Key Features

- **Input Data Collection**: Accepts user-input data, including soil parameters, climate details, and geographic location.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalizes/scales features, and transforms categorical variables for better model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes various algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting to build predictive models.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trains models on historical data, evaluates their accuracy, and ensures reliable predictions.
- **Crop Recommendation**: Provides crop recommendations based on trained models and user-provided input parameters.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple, intuitive interface allows users to input data, view crop recommendations, and access additional information.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For model development, data preprocessing, and backend.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **Flask**: For building the web interface and managing HTTP requests.
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For client-side interactions and enhanced UX.
